    <h2>Client Agreement & Terms of Service</h2>
    <p class="terms-sub">Please read and accept the following terms before accessing your dashboard.</p>

    <div class="terms-box">
        <h3>1. Investment Advisory Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>EFP Wealth provides portfolio advisory services based on quantitative, systematic investment strategies. All investment recommendations are generated by proprietary models and are not personalized financial advice. Past performance, whether backtested or live, does not guarantee future results. The value of investments can go down as well as up, and you may receive back less than your original investment.</p>

        <h3>2. Risk Factors</h3>
        <p>Investments in securities are subject to market risks, including but not limited to: equity market volatility, sector concentration risk, liquidity risk, and model risk. The strategies employed may experience drawdowns exceeding 20% from peak values. Regime allocation models may not accurately predict all market conditions. You should only invest capital that you can afford to lose and should consider your own risk tolerance before investing.</p>

        <h3>3. Fee Structure</h3>
        <p>Management fees, performance fees, and other charges will be communicated separately in your individual client agreement. Transaction costs, taxes, securities transaction tax (STT), goods and services tax (GST), and stamp duty are borne by the client. Slippage and market impact costs may affect actual returns versus model returns.</p>

        <h3>4. Data Privacy</h3>
        <p>EFP Wealth collects and stores your personal information (name, email, phone, PAN) solely for the purpose of providing advisory services and regulatory compliance.
